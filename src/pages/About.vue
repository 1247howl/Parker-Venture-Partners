            <strong>We are a newly formed Universal conglomerate with partners in various industries. Today's innovators were yesterday's instigators. Working together, imagine what we'll accomplish tomorrow.

            <br/>
             Many so-called experts in the venture capital world have been one basic approach to how they do business: Inject lots of capital into the enterprise, pile on the debt, and then take over the board and squeeze the original innovator out. <strong>That model is broken.</strong> 
             <br/>
