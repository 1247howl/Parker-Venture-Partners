Ghost has a powerful visual editor with familiar formatting options, as well as the ability to seamlessly add dynamic content.

Select the text to add formatting, headers or create links, or use Markdown shortcuts to do the work for you - if that's your thing. 

## Rich editing at your fingertips

The editor can also handle rich media objects, called cards.

You can insert a card either by clicking the  +  button on a new line, or typing  /  on a new line to search for a particular card. This allows you to efficiently insert images, markdown, html and embeds.
