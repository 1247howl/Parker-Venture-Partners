 By promoting the fastest growing Microgreens that **encompass nutrition matching eight vegetables.** This tiny plant acheives this, in addition to the flavor enhancement. We will capture the fastest growing segment of the restaurant industry. Healthy, fresh organically grown food and beverages is the number one consumers choice today and we will be the leaders in this industry naionwide.

**We under contract to acquire three restaurant chains in Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco to focus on the fastest growing segment of the food and beverage industry.**

 These acquisitions will be the beginning of a nationwide 1000 store chain of restaurants featuring Hemp products (CBD/HEMP) and Microgreens to be infused into food and beverage coming directly from our farming operations. 
 **This concept is to provide the newest and latest "farm to table" concept with organic hemp and highy nutritious microgreen ingredients into our restaurant menus.**
